<h1>Network Activities</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we will create a Windows 10 and Ubuntu virtual machines (VM) in Azure and perform some network activities. Specifically, we will work with Azure Network Security Groups (Firewall Resources), Wireshark (a protocal analyzer), and a bunch of command-line tools. The purpose of this lab is to gain a better understanding of firewalls and solidify our understanding of network protocols and ports.
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

  
<h2>Creating Windows 10 VM in Azure:</h2>

The first thing we will do is create a Windows 10 VM in Azure. Follow the following images below and create an exact replica VM. Don't create a resource group; we will let Azure create a resource group for us.Â <br/>

Make Sure to create your own username and password for the VM we will use it to log into the computer.

Open Remote Desktop Connection on your computer and type in the public IP address of your VM shown in the VM portal. Follow it up by enetering the VM credentials we created.

You will now be logged into the windows 10 VM. Go through the setup screen until you arrive at the homepage.
