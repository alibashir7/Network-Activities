<h1>Network Activities</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we will create a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) in Azure and perform some network activities. Specifically, we will work with Azure Network Security Groups (Firewall Resources), Wireshark (a protocal analyzer), and a bunch of command-line tools. The purpose of this lab is to gain a better understanding of firewalls and solidify our understanding of network protocols and ports.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

  
<h2>Creating Windows 10 VM in Azure:</h2>

The first thing we will do is create a Windows 10 VM in Azure. Follow the following images below and create an exact replica VM. Don't create a resource group; we will let the VM create its own resource group.Â <br/>
